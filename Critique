While creating this website, I intended to make it clean, accessible, and organized which will help with research guidance for students.  I focused on an easy-to-read layout, ensuring that the headings stood out clearly to help users navigate the content easily. I tried to use a consistent color scheme and font selection so that the website was more approachable.  


If I had more time on this website, I would have implemented more visual elements, such as animations or icons, to make it more engaging for users. Additionally, I would focus on enhancing the CSS by adding media queries to ensure the design is fully responsive and functional across various devices and screen sizes. I would also make sure that the website doesnâ€™t have too many spaces. User testing would also be a priority, as gathering feedback would allow me to identify and resolve any usability issues, ensuring a smoother user experience. These additional steps would help create a more well-rounded site.
