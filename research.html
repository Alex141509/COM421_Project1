    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Getting Started</h2>
      <h3>Accessing Library Services</h3>
      <p>If you are newly admitted and don't yet have an IIT Hawk Card, details for obtaining it can be found on the
        Hawk Card homepage. Your Hawk Card is required for some library services, though many are accessible online using
        your IIT login credentials.</p>
      <p>To access the library website, log into <strong>myIIT</strong> and click on the "Library Resources" link. This allows proxy access to most resources without additional login prompts.</p>
      <div class="imageinsert">
        <img src="illustrations/research2.jpg" alt="Library Services Icon" class="image">
        <p class="caption">The Library Services icon leads you to the library search website.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Research Timelines</h2>
      <h3>Formulating a Timeline</h3>
      <p>Consider the following formula when deciding if a resource can be realistically used for your paper:</p>
      <p><strong>Time to obtain resource + Time to read resource + Time to integrate into project < Remaining time before
          deadline</strong></p>
      <p>Breaking it down:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Time to obtain:</strong> How long will it take for an interlibrary loan or physically getting the
          resource?</li>
        <li><strong>Time to read:</strong> Realistically assess how long it will take you to read the resource.</li>
        <li><strong>Time to integrate:</strong> Do you have time to include the new insights in your paper/project?</li>
        <li><strong>Remaining time:</strong> Consider the remaining time before your submission deadline.</li>
      </ul>

      <aside>
        <h3>Be Realistic</h3>
        <p><strong>Avoid planning to read an entire scholarly book in one day. Be practical with your time
            management.</strong></p>
      </aside>

      <h3>Case Study: Example Research Timeline</h3>
      <p>Bridgette, a Tech Comm grad student, plans a paper on the development of technical communication. After logging
        into myIIT, she finds several articles that require interlibrary loan. She creates a timeline using her Google
        calendar, deciding whether to request materials or use resources that are more readily available.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Requesting Resources</h2>
      <h3>Requesting Articles</h3>
      <p>Some articles may not be directly downloadable, and you will need to request them via MyILL. Set up a MyILL
        account for requesting articles and view your requested articles online when available.</p>
      <div class="imageinsert">
        <img src="illustrations/research4_image1.jpg" alt="Article Request" class="image">
      </div>

      <h3>Requesting Books from Other Libraries</h3>
      <p>If a book is unavailable in IIT's library system, try I-Share, and if needed, WorldCat. Both systems allow
        interlibrary loan services. Keep track of your resources by using a shared document like Google Docs.</p>

      <aside>
        <h3>Tip</h3>
        <p><strong>Keep a record of the books and articles you are using to avoid losing track of valuable resources.</strong></p>
      </aside>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Local Libraries</h2>
      <p><strong>I-Share Libraries</strong> allow you to check out books directly if you have an IIT ID card. For
        example, UIC's Daley Library has extensive resources and open stacks access for IIT students.</p>

      <aside>
        <h3>Tip</h3>
        <p><strong>Call libraries ahead of time to confirm access, especially if they are not part of I-Share.</strong></p>
      </aside>

      <p><strong>Public Libraries</strong> in Chicago, like the Chicago Public Library (CPL), provide access to a broad
        range of resources, though some require residency for borrowing privileges.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Finding Resources on the Web</h2>
      <h3>Some Web Resources</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://scholar.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Scholar</a> - Search for academic articles and see citations.</li>
        <li><a href="https://books.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Books</a> - Preview books and explore references.</li>
        <li><a href="http://thomsonreuters.com/products_services/science/science_products/a-z/web_of_science" target="_blank">Web of Science</a> â€“ Search scientific papers.</li>
      </ul>

      <aside>
        <h3>Tip</h3>
        <p><strong>Look for special issues or edited volumes in Technical Communication to gain a broad overview of key scholarship on your topic.</strong></p>
