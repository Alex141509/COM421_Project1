      </ul>

      <p>After reading the sections, take a short quiz to reflect on the strategies.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  
        <h3>Accessing Library Services</h3>
        <p>If you’re newly admitted and don’t have an IIT Hawk Card, you’ll need one for certain library services. Even without a card, you can still access online journals and use the library's search functions.</p>
  
        <h3>Using myIIT to Access the Library Website</h3>
        <p>Access the library website by first logging into myIIT. From there, click on "Library Resources" to use a proxy server connection that allows you to access most resources without reentering login details.</p>
  
        <div class="imageinsert">
          <img src="illustrations/research2.jpg" class="image" alt="Library Services Icon">
          <p class="caption">The Library Services icon leads you to the library search website.</p>
        </div>
  
        <p>The best place to start research is in a scholarly database like Academic Search Premiere (EBSCO).</p>
      </section>
  
      <section>
        <h2>Research Timelines</h2>
  
        <h3>Formulating a Timeline</h3>
        <p>Consider your project deadline when requesting resources. Use this formula:</p>
  
        <p><strong>Time to obtain resource + Time to read resource + Time to integrate resource < Remaining time before deadline</strong></p>
  
        <h3>Being Realistic</h3>
        <p><strong>Don’t assume you can read an entire scholarly book in one day. Choose resources you can realistically read within your timeline.</strong></p>
  
        <h3>Case Study: Research Timeline Example</h3>
        <p>Bridgette, a graduate student, sets up a timeline to ensure she has enough time to wait for resources, read them, and integrate them into her paper. She uses Google Calendar to track her research goals.</p>
      </section>
  
      <section>
        <h2>Requesting Resources</h2>
  
        <h3>Requesting Articles</h3>
        <p>If articles aren't available for PDF download, you can request them via MyILL. Setup a MyILL account, and once ready, you’ll be notified by email when articles are available for download.</p>
  
        <h3>Requesting Books</h3>
        <p>If you can't find a book in the IIT library system, check I-Share and WorldCat. Keep a list of resources using tools like Google Docs for easy reference.</p>
  
        <h3>Case Study: Searching and Requesting Resources</h3>
        <p>Bridgette makes a note to find the book "English for Engineers" by S.A. Harbarger in the UIC library, as noted in her Google Docs resource list.</p>
      </section>
  
      <section>
        <h2>Local Libraries</h2>
        <p>Use local libraries when:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>You don’t have enough time for interlibrary loan</li>
          <li>The book isn’t available through interlibrary loan</li>
        </ol>
  
        <p>Libraries like UIC’s Daley Library are great for accessing extensive resources. However, always check policies and hours before visiting.</p>
      </section>
  
      <section>
        <h2>Internet Resources</h2>
  
        <h3>Some Resources to Consider</h3>
        <p>Consider using public domain writings, Creative Commons-licensed works, or media files available online to save time.</p>
  
        <h3>Using Web Resources for Research</h3>
        <p>Use resources like Google Scholar, Google Books, or Web of Science to search for additional articles or references.</p>
  
        <h3>Case Study: Using Web Resources</h3>
        <p>Bridgette uses Google Scholar to find articles that reference R.J. Connors' "The Rise of Technical Writing Instruction in America."</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>We hope this lesson helped you with research strategies. Now, take the short quiz to retain key points from this lesson.</p>
